        <p>I am a software developer living in Barcelona, Spain.</p>
        <p>As a former Registered Nurse, I'm interested in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Web design that solves problems and creates new solutions.</li>
          <li>Quality code that helps both companies and consumers.</li>
          <li>Collaborating with others towards a common goal.</li>
        </ul>

        </header>
        <p>I've enjoyed my experience as a nurse since 2017, and have worked for companies like Kaiser Permanente, UCSF, UCSD and Stanford. 
        Working in the front lines of the pandemic really emphasized the importance of spending time with family. We decided to move as a family 
        from California to Spain so our children could enjoy a multilingual education free from the risks of gun violence at school. Being a 
        software developer allows me to spend more time with my family while still employing my gifts as a problem-solver and team-player.</p>
        <p>As a student at Thinkful, I'm one step closer to living that dream and I am so excited!</p>
        <p>If you are seeking to hire a new developer or are looking for another teammate for your hackathon, please reach out! I am so excited 
        to work with other developers to create elegant solutions for your company.</p>
